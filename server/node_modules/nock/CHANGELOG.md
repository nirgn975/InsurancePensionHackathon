  * 9.0.21
  * fix: compare falsy header values & numbers correctly
  * test: match number header values
  * multiple interceptors override headers from unrelated requests

9.0.19 / 2017-09-22
===================

  * 9.0.19
  * Improve Nock Back documentation
  * Fix file permissions of intercept test
  * Fix allowUnmocked when last interceptor was removed.
  * Do not abort a an already aborted request, do not emit an error twice
    Fixes [#882](https://github.com/node-nock/nock/issues/882)
    When a request is aborted, "nock" emits an "abort"-error.
    If the client reacts on that error by aborting the request (this is what
    "popsicle" does), the code will end in an endless loop.
    This commit makes that the the "abort"-code is only executed, if the
    request has not already been aborted.
  * fix broken link: allow-unmocked-requests-on-a-mocked-hostname
  * fix: Specified request body not properly enforced ([#921](https://github.com/node-nock/nock/issues/921))
  * Minor change in example code `scope(` => `var scope = nock(`
  * nockBack.setMode: Improve error message
  * chore(CHANGELOG): v9.0.18

    change `the response event will occur immediately, but the IncomingMessage not it's end event until after the delay` -> `the response event will occur immediately, but the IncomingMessage will not emit it's end event until after the delay`
  * Improve Match Logging
    Currently, matching logging does not include the method or path of the request.  I have added these to make debugging non-matches easier.
  * Update README.md
    please review for accuracy. I actually don't know how it behaves but this section was very confusing to read.
